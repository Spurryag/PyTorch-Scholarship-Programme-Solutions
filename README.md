# PyTorch Udacity Scholarship Solutions

This repo contains my solutions to the problems provided in the PyTorch Scholarship Programme focused on Deep Learning.

The different types of Neural Networks explored are:
* Perceptron 
* Multi-layer Perceptron [Applied to MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets]
* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
